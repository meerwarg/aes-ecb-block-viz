# aes-ecb-block-viz
Small cmdline tool to visualize how prefix padding affects AES ECB blocks. Helpful to understand how the blocks are arranged in various crypto CTF challenges.

Run the tool (`ecb-block-visualizer.py`) and enter the amount of bytes you want to prepend. The tool will show you what parts of the default 60-bytes value will be in what block.
